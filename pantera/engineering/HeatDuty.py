"""
Class for computing heat duty

This class performs simple thermodynamic calculations
to allow for heat duty and temperature change calculations.

Perfect heaters:
* You can specify a heat duty, and see what the final temperature is
* You can specify a final temperatue, and see what the heat duty required is

Heat loss heaters:
* You can specify a heat tansfer coefficient, and do same as above
* You can specify a heat loss percentage, and do same as above
