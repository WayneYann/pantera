This Python module will \r\nmake it even more useful, by providing some functionality commonly\r\nused in engineering calculations, and by giving you ideas about how\r\nyou can extend Cantera for your own uses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n# Installing Pantera\r\n\r\nPantera has a couple of dependencies. Once these are installed,\r\nyou can do the usual setup.py thing to install Pantera.\r\n\r\n## Dependencies\r\n\r\nIn order to use Pantera, you will, at the very least, need to install Cantera. \r\nThere are other features of Pantera that require other libraries. Their dependencies\r\nare optional.\r\n\r\nRequired:\r\n* Cantera\r\n* JSON\r\n\r\nOptional:\r\n* Matplotlib\r\n* itertools\r\n\r\n## Installing\r\n\r\nYou can install Pantera by using setup.py:\r\n\r\n```\r\npython setup.py install\r\n```\r\n\r\nthen import pantera like any other library:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport pantera as pt\r\n```\r\n\r\n# What's in the Pantera Library?\r\n\r\n## Pantera Core\r\n\r\nThe core of the Pantera library is the source code in the ```pantera``` directory.\r\nThis is divided into various sub-modules.\r\n\r\nYou can explore the various submodules of Pantera\r\n[at the Pantera core source code README.md file](pantera/README.md)\r\n\r\n## Tests\r\n\r\nThe Pantera library uses nose as the unit testing framework. \r\nThe ```tests``` directory contains nose tests that cover various\r\nparts of the Pantera library.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n# Getting Started\r\n\r\nYou can import the pantera library into Python like this:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport pantera as pt\r\n```\r\n\r\nOnce that import statement is working,\r\nyou can explore the various submodules of Pantera\r\n[at the Pantera core source code README.md file](pantera/README.md)\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
